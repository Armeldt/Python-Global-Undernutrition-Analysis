As part of this project, I worked on a fictional scenario involving a team at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The goal was to conduct an extensive study on global undernutrition, using real-world datasets to analyze food consumption patterns and hunger across different regions.

I was responsible for handling the data, performing exploratory analysis, and generating insights to support the FAO's mission of building a world free from hunger. Using tools like Python, I had the flexibility to enhance the provided analysis and add my own interpretations to help deepen the understanding of global nutrition issues.
